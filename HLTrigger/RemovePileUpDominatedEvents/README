Hi Roberval,
to avoid the pile-up rate double counting, you have to download this code

git clone git@github.com:cms-steam/RemovePileUpDominatedEvents.git RemovePileUpDominatedEvents
scram b

and then you have to add this filter in your HLT configuration

process.RemovePileUpDominatedEventsGen = cms.EDFilter("RemovePileUpDominatedEventsGen")

and finally add it in your path (for instance in your HLTBeginSequence):

process.HLTBeginSequence = ( .... + process.RemovePileUpDominatedEventsGen )


I didn't test this recipes since a while, sorry if you get errors!
The filter rejects events with having a PU collision with pt-hat greater than the QCD collision pt-hat.

You can see quickly the problem thinking about the ZeroBias trigger.
If you evaluate the ZeroBias trigger rate using the formula L*cross-section, you would get ~ 40 (pile-up)
* 40 MHz instead of 40MHz (there is a double counting due to pile-up)
